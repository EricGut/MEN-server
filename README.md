# Server with MEN (MongoDb, express and Node)

This is an easy example of a server made in node with express and MongoDb.

## What does this server do

It's a simple server where you can register users, login with'em and see the users register in the DB.
All the tests must be done with postman or similar.

## Try it for frontend

This example is just the backend version, but you can try to add it in whatever frontend you use :)

## Routes

```bash
    /api/users // to render users
    /api/register
    /api/login
    /api/seed // to create a test user
```
